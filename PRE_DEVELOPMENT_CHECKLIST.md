# Pre-Development Checklist

Before we begin active development, this document identifies critical areas that need additional planning or clarification.

## 1. UI/UX Design Framework

We've outlined general UI concepts but need more specific designs:

- [ ] Create HUD wireframes showing health, resources, equipment, etc.
- [ ] Design inventory management system interface
- [ ] Map out crafting interface flow
- [ ] Design village hub interface elements
- [ ] Create mockups of key interaction prompts

## 2. Asset Requirements List

We should create a concrete list of required assets:

- [ ] Block textures (terrain types, structural elements)
- [ ] Entity models (player, enemies, resources)
- [ ] Animation requirements
- [ ] Sound effects list
- [ ] Music tracks needed

## 3. Narrative Framework

While mechanics are our focus, some minimal story elements would enhance the experience:

- [ ] Establish basic world backstory
- [ ] Create context for the cyberpunk village and dungeons
- [ ] Design NPC characters for the hub area
- [ ] Write dialogue snippets for key interactions
- [ ] Create environmental storytelling elements

## 4. Technical Prototype Plan

We should identify the core elements to prototype first:

- [ ] Define minimum viable product (MVP) features
- [ ] Create a prioritized list of physics interactions to test
- [ ] Plan initial networking tests for multiplayer
- [ ] Outline benchmarking methodology for performance testing
- [ ] Establish criteria for "proof of concept" completion

## 5. HYTOPIA SDK Integration Details

We need concrete implementation notes for key HYTOPIA systems:

- [ ] Document specific SDK methods for physics-based combat
- [ ] Identify entity creation and management patterns
- [ ] Research best practices for multiplayer synchronization
- [ ] Determine terrain manipulation limitations and techniques
- [ ] Create sample code snippets for essential systems

## 6. Testing Strategy

We need a structured approach to testing:

- [ ] Create playtest scripts for specific features
- [ ] Develop feedback collection forms/methods
- [ ] Establish performance benchmarking processes
- [ ] Schedule regular testing milestones
- [ ] Identify key metrics for success (both technical and player enjoyment)

## 7. Performance Optimization Strategy

To support our ambitious multiplayer goals:

- [ ] Define performance targets for different player counts
- [ ] Identify likely bottlenecks (physics, networking, rendering)
- [ ] Create progressive fallback strategies for performance issues
- [ ] Design LOD (level of detail) system framework
- [ ] Plan for network optimization techniques

## 8. Community Features Implementation

For our MMO-focused approach:

- [ ] Design player contribution tracking system
- [ ] Create community goal framework
- [ ] Plan guild/team mechanics
- [ ] Design village expansion system
- [ ] Create asynchronous collaboration features

## 9. Development Risk Assessment

We should identify and plan for potential challenges:

- [ ] List technically challenging features and fallback options
- [ ] Create scope reduction plan if time becomes limited
- [ ] Identify dependencies and potential bottlenecks
- [ ] Plan feature priority if we need to cut scope
- [ ] Establish "must have" vs. "nice to have" features

## 10. Initial Development Sprint Plan

Break down the first development sprint:

- [ ] List first-week development goals
- [ ] Assign priority to specific features
- [ ] Create daily milestone targets
- [ ] Establish review points
- [ ] Define iteration strategy for early prototypes

## Action Plan

1. **Day 1**: Focus on UI/UX Design and Asset Requirements
2. **Day 2**: Create Technical Prototype Plan and HYTOPIA SDK integration details
3. **Day 3**: Develop Testing Strategy and Performance Optimization Strategy
4. **Day 4**: Design Community Features and Assess Development Risks
5. **Day 5**: Finalize Initial Development Sprint Plan and begin implementation

This approach ensures we have a comprehensive foundation before beginning active development, reducing the risk of rework and helping us stay focused on our core vision.
