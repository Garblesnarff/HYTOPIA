## Game Concept

A sci-fi rogue-lite dungeon crawler where players:
1. Build and upgrade a base in a cyberpunk village
2. Gather resources from the environment
3. Craft tools, weapons, and cybernetic enhancements
4. Explore procedurally generated dungeons
5. Battle enemies and challenging bosses
6. Optionally team up with or fight against other players

The game will be built using the HYTOPIA SDK with AI-assisted "vibe coding" to accelerate development.

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine planning documents
2. Answer outstanding questions
3. Set up development environment
4. Begin implementing core game systems
