# Source Code Directory

This directory contains all the source code for the CyberCrawler game.

## Directory Structure

- `core/` - Core game system implementations and utilities
- `entities/` - Entity definitions, controllers, and factories
- `systems/` - Game systems (combat, crafting, inventory, etc.)
- `world/` - World generation, terrain, and environment code
- `index.js` - Main entry point for the game server

## Key Files

- `index.js` - Server initialization and main game loop
- (More files will be added as they are developed)

## Code Organization

Our codebase is organized to maximize readability and maintainability for both humans and AI assistants. Each directory has its own README explaining its contents and purpose.

We follow these principles:
1. Files are kept under 200 lines of code
2. Each file has a single responsibility
3. Functions are short and focused
4. Every directory has a README.md
5. Code is thoroughly documented

## Usage

The game server is started by running the main `index.js` file, which initializes all required systems and begins the game loop.
