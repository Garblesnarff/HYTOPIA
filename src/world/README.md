# World Generation and Management

This directory contains code related to world generation, environment management, and terrain systems.

## Purpose

The world modules handle the creation and management of the game environment, including the village hub, procedurally generated dungeons, terrain features, and environmental effects.

## Key Components

- **Village Hub Generation** - Creating the main player village/base area
- **Dungeon Generation** - Procedural generation of dungeon levels
- **Terrain Systems** - Handling terrain properties and interactions
- **Environment Effects** - Weather, lighting, and atmospheric effects
- **World Serialization** - Saving and loading world data

## Files

(Files will be added as they are developed)

## World Structure

Our game world consists of:

1. **Village Hub** - Central safe area with crafting stations and player housing
2. **Dungeon Entrance** - Fixed location that leads to procedural dungeons
3. **Dungeon Levels** - Procedurally generated areas with increasing difficulty
4. **Special Areas** - Unique locations that may appear in the procedural dungeons

## Procedural Generation Approach

Our dungeon generation uses several algorithms:
- Room-based generation with connected corridors
- Cellular automata for organic areas
- Template-based special rooms
- Difficulty scaling based on depth

## Usage Examples

```javascript
// Example usage (to be updated as code is written)
import { DungeonGenerator } from '../world/dungeon-generator.js';

const dungeonGenerator = new DungeonGenerator({
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
  rooms: {
    min: 10,
    max: 20
  },
  difficulty: 3
});

const dungeonLevel = dungeonGenerator.generate();
```
