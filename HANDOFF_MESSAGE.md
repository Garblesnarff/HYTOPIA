# CyberCrawler Project Handoff

We've been developing plans for "CyberCrawler," a sci-fi rogue-lite dungeon crawler/crafting sim for the HYTOPIA Game Jam 2. The project focuses on leveraging HYTOPIA's physics capabilities to create an MMO-style game with physics-based combat and community features.

## Project Structure & Location

All project files are located in `/Users/rob/Claude/HYTOPIA/` with the following key documents:

1. `README.md` - Overview of the project structure
2. `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - High-level concept and core features
3. `GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md` - Detailed game design including systems and mechanics
4. `TECHNICAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Technical specifications and requirements
5. `TECHNICAL_PROTOTYPE_PLAN.md` - Plan for creating the initial prototype
6. `HYTOPIA_SDK_INTEGRATION.md` - Detailed implementation patterns for HYTOPIA SDK
7. `WEAPONS_ABILITIES_PROGRESSION.md` - Comprehensive breakdown of combat systems
8. `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` - Key design decisions including visual style and multiplayer
9. `COMBAT_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` - Physics-based combat system design
10. `CODE_STANDARDS.md` - Coding standards optimized for LLM readability
11. `PRE_DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Remaining items to address before development
12. `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Development phases and timeline

## Current Status

We've completed the planning phase, focusing on designing a physics-based combat system that leverages HYTOPIA's capabilities. The key unique aspects of our design include:

1. **Physics-Based Combat**: A momentum-based attack system where movement and positioning affect damage
2. **MMO Community Features**: Support for 50+ players in the hub and 16+ in dungeons
3. **Procedural Generation**: Multilayered dungeon generation with varied environments
4. **Crafting & Progression**: Cybernetic enhancement system with specialization paths

## Next Steps

We're ready to begin the implementation phase, starting with setting up the development environment and creating a prototype. Here are the immediate next steps:

1. **Set up HYTOPIA SDK Development Environment**
   - Install the SDK using npm/bun
   - Configure the project structure
   - Test basic connectivity

2. **Implement Core Player Controller**
   - Physics-based movement
   - Camera controls
   - Basic animation states

3. **Create a Test Environment**
   - Simple static area for movement testing
   - Basic lighting and boundaries
   - Development tools for debugging

4. **Begin Combat System Implementation**
   - Physics-based hit detection
   - Momentum damage calculations
   - Basic weapon functionality

## Development Approach

We're using "vibe coding" with AI assistance as per the game jam requirements, focusing on:
- Modular, small files (<200 lines) with clear documentation
- Physics-driven gameplay that showcases HYTOPIA's strengths
- Iterative development with frequent testing

## Role Request

Please help continue this project by implementing the next steps outlined above. Start by exploring the existing documentation to understand the project, then help create the initial development environment and begin implementing the core features for our prototype.

The main focus should be on creating functional, physics-based gameplay mechanics rather than visual polish or complete features. We're looking to validate our core concepts through a playable prototype.

Feel free to ask questions about any aspect of the project design or offer suggestions for improvements based on your understanding of the HYTOPIA SDK and game development best practices.
