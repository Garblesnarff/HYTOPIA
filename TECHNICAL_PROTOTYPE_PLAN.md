# Technical Prototype Plan

This document outlines our approach to creating a minimum viable prototype of CyberCrawler that focuses on core gameplay mechanics and leverages HYTOPIA's strengths.

## Prototype Goals

1. **Validate Core Gameplay Loop**: Confirm that our physics-based combat, resource gathering, and basic crafting systems are fun and engaging
2. **Test HYTOPIA's Multiplayer Capabilities**: Ensure our design scales well with multiple players
3. **Evaluate Performance Parameters**: Identify potential bottlenecks in entity count, physics simulation, and network synchronization
4. **Establish Development Patterns**: Create reusable code structures for the full development phase

## MVP Features

For our initial prototype, we'll focus on implementing these core features:

1. **Basic Movement System**

   - Camera controls optimized for third-person view

2. **Physics-Based Combat (Core Focus)**
   - Momentum-based attack system
   - Simple melee and ranged weapon implementations
   - Basic enemy AI with physics responses
   - Hit detection and damage calculations

3. **Resource Collection**
   - Collectible resource entities with basic physics
   - Simple inventory system
   - Resource categories (common, uncommon)

4. **Simplified Crafting**
   - One crafting station that creates basic weapons

## Prototype Testing Methodology

### 1. Technical Testing

| Test Area | Metrics | Method |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Performance | FPS, Entity Count, Physics Load | Automated benchmarking |
| Networking | Latency, Packet Loss, Sync Issues | Multiple-client testing |
| Physics Behavior | Collision Accuracy, Momentum Effects | Scenario testing |
| Generation Quality | Room Connectivity, Variation | Visual inspection |

### 2. Gameplay Testing

| Test Area | Focus | Method |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Combat Feel | Responsiveness, Impact, Satisfaction | Playtest feedback |
| Resource Loop | Collection Pace, Reward Feeling | Timed play sessions |
| Crafting | Clarity, Reward Value | Task completion rates |
| Multiplayer | Interaction Quality, Coordination | Group testing sessions |

## Technical Risk Assessment

| Risk Area | Potential Issues | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Physics Performance | Too many active physics entities | Implement LOD system, physics culling |
| Network Synchronization | Delayed physics replication | Use client prediction, server reconciliation |
| Entity Management | Memory issues with many entities | Implement entity pooling, optimize spawning |
| Procedural Generation | Generation taking too long | Implement async generation, chunk-based approach |

## Prototype Success Criteria

Our prototype will be considered successful if it meets these criteria:

1. **Performance**: Maintains 60+ FPS with 8+ players and 50+ physics entities
2. **Network Quality**: Provides responsive gameplay with < 100ms latency
3. **Gameplay Feel**: Combat and movement receive positive feedback in playtests
4. **Technical Viability**: Core systems demonstrate scalability for full implementation

## Development Tools

- **IDE**: VSCode with JavaScript/TypeScript extensions
- **Version Control**: Git with regular commits
- **Testing Tools**: Chrome Dev Tools for performance monitoring
- **Documentation**: Markdown files with clear structure

## Conclusion

This technical prototype will focus on validating our core gameplay mechanics while ensuring we're leveraging HYTOPIA's strengths in physics and multiplayer. By concentrating on the essential features first, we can quickly determine if our concept is technically viable and engaging before committing to full-scale development.
