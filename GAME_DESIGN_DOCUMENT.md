# CyberCrawler - Game Design Document

## Game Concept

CyberCrawler is a sci-fi rogue-lite dungeon crawler with crafting mechanics built for the HYTOPIA Game Jam 2. Players explore procedurally generated dungeons, gather resources, craft items, and enhance their character with cybernetic upgrades.

## Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Explore** the cyberpunk village hub and interact with characters
2. **Gather** resources from the environment and defeated enemies
3. **Craft** and upgrade equipment, weapons, and cybernetic enhancements
4. **Delve** into the procedurally generated dungeon
5. **Battle** enemies and bosses
6. **Advance** deeper or return to the hub with gathered resources
7. **Improve** your character and base between runs

## Game Systems

### 1. Resource Gathering - IMPLEMENTED

Players can collect various types of resources throughout the game world:

| Resource Type | Rarity | Found In | Used For |
|---------------|--------|----------|----------|
| Scrap Metal | Common | Throughout environment, defeated drones | Basic crafting, structures |
| Tech Components | Uncommon | Security systems, defeated robots | Gadgets, weapons |
| Mutated Plants | Uncommon | Overgrown areas | Potions, biological enhancements |
| Energy Cells | Uncommon | Power systems | High-tech items |
| Rare Metals | Rare | Deep dungeon areas | Advanced weapons, armor |
| Ancient Artifacts | Very Rare | Boss rewards, hidden areas | Special abilities |
| Nanobots | Rare | Research facilities | Repairs, cybernetic upgrades |

**IMPLEMENTED**: Scrap Metal and Mutated Plants are fully implemented and can be gathered from the world. Both resources are spawned at predefined locations in the world (using the spawnMutatedPlants and spawnScrapMetal functions). They use appropriate 3D models and are added to the player's inventory upon collection. The resource database includes definitions for all planned resources, but only these two are currently spawned and gatherable.

### 2. Crafting System - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

The crafting system allows players to create items using gathered resources. Different crafting stations enable different types of items:

#### Crafting Stations

1. **Basic Workbench - IMPLEMENTED**
   - First station available
   - Crafts simple tools, weapons, and structural elements
   - Required resources: Mostly scrap metal

2. **Cybernetics Lab - TO BE IMPLEMENTED**
   - Creates and installs cybernetic enhancements
   - Requires: Tech components, rare metals
   - Allows character customization and ability upgrades

3. **Tech Workshop - TO BE IMPLEMENTED**
   - Creates electronic gadgets and advanced weapons
   - Requires: Tech components, energy cells
   - Produces ranged weapons and utility items

4. **Chemistry Station - TO BE IMPLEMENTED**
   - Creates healing items, buffs, and special concoctions
   - Requires: Mutated plants, energy cells
   - Produces consumables that provide temporary effects

**IMPLEMENTED**: The Basic Workbench crafting table is fully implemented as the CraftingTableEntity class. Players can approach crafting tables and interact with them (using the 'E' key) to open a crafting interface. The crafting system has a complete recipe database with multiple craftable items across different categories. The CraftingManager singleton class handles all crafting operations, including checking for required materials, processing crafting requests, and updating the player's inventory. The crafting UI is also implemented, showing available recipes, required materials (with quantities owned), and providing visual feedback during the crafting process.

### 3. Character Progression - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

Player progression occurs through several systems:

#### Run-Based Progression
- Weapons and items found during dungeon runs
- Temporary buffs and power-ups
- Resources that can be brought back to the hub

#### Permanent Progression
- Cybernetic enhancements that persist between runs
- Base improvements (upgraded crafting stations)
- New crafting recipes unlocked

#### Skill-Based Progression
- Player knowledge of enemy patterns
- Combat techniques and strategies
- Dungeon layout recognition

**IMPLEMENTED**: Basic player health system and dash ability have been fully implemented. The health system includes a max health of 100 and a visual health bar in the HUD, implemented as a 3D SceneUI element that follows the player. The dash ability is implemented in the CyberCrawlerController (which extends PlayerEntityController) and is triggered with right-click. The dash has a cooldown period tracked in the playerState. Players can gather resources which are properly stored in their inventory using the InventoryManager. The more advanced progression elements like cybernetic enhancements are not yet implemented.

### 4. Combat System - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

Combat is real-time and skill-based, utilizing the HYTOPIA physics system:

#### Weapon Types
- **Melee**: Close-range weapons like vibro-blades and power fists
- **Ranged**: Energy pistols, scrap launchers, tech rifles
- **Area Effect**: EMP grenades, nano clouds
- **Deployable**: Turrets, drones, traps

#### Enemy Types
- **Security Drones**: Basic ranged enemies
- **Corrupted Workers**: Melee attackers
- **Mutants**: Fast and aggressive
- **Heavy Mechs**: Slow, heavily armored
- **Hacker Units**: Disrupt player abilities
- **Swarm Robots**: Weak individually but dangerous in groups
- **Elite Guards**: Mini-boss enemies with special attacks

#### Boss Encounters
- Unique boss battles at certain dungeon depths
- Multiple attack patterns and phases
- Special rewards for defeating bosses

**IMPLEMENTED**: The core structure for the combat system is in place but currently disabled due to SDK limitations. The CyberCrawlerController includes a performMeleeAttack function that will be enabled once proper hit detection is available. The current implementation uses raycast for hit detection and includes placeholder logic for damage calculation. Enemy types have been designed but are not yet implemented. The combat system is structured to work with the HYTOPIA physics system but requires further development before it's fully functional.

### 5. Dungeon Generation - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

The dungeon is procedurally generated using multiple algorithms:

#### Dungeon Structure
- **Facility Areas**: Structured rooms and corridors (Room-based generation)
- **Maintenance Tunnels**: Narrow pathways connecting areas (BSP algorithm)
- **Overgrown Sections**: Natural cave-like areas (Cellular automata)
- **Special Rooms**: Hand-designed rooms inserted into the procedural layout

#### Dungeon Features
- **Hacking Terminals**: Unlock doors or reveal secrets
- **Power Nodes**: Activate/deactivate security systems
- **Radiation Zones**: Damage over time unless protected
- **Scrap Piles**: Resource-rich areas
- **Abandoned Labs**: High-risk, high-reward areas
- **Secret Caches**: Hidden rooms with rare loot

#### Difficulty Scaling
- Deeper levels contain stronger enemies
- Resource quality increases with depth
- Environmental hazards become more dangerous

**IMPLEMENTED**: World generation with a complete 500x500 block map is implemented in the world-map.ts file. The world includes defined areas (village center, player house, tech district, etc.) and various terrain features like hills, valleys, and water bodies. Connections between areas via paths are implemented with proper block placement. The world generation includes functions for area delineation, terrain feature creation, and path connection. A block type registry system is also implemented to support different block types in the world. The procedural dungeon generation inside dungeon areas is not yet implemented - currently only the surface world generation is working.

### 6. Multiplayer Interactions - TO BE IMPLEMENTED

The game supports multiplayer with various interaction types:

#### Cooperative Play
- Team up to explore dungeons
- Share resources and crafting abilities
- Revive fallen teammates

#### Optional PvP
- Combat between players in specific dungeon zones
- Resource stealing
- Competitive boss hunting

#### Shared Base Building
- Multiple players can contribute to village development
- Specialized roles (combat, resource gathering, crafting)

**IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**: Basic player join/leave handling is implemented in the main index.ts file. Players can connect to the server and see each other, but advanced multiplayer features like cooperative play, resource sharing, and PvP elements are not yet implemented.

## Art Style

CyberCrawler features a voxel-based cyberpunk aesthetic:

### Visual Elements
- Neon-lit environments against dark backgrounds
- Vertical urban sprawl with multiple levels
- Mix of high-tech and decrepit structures
- Holographic displays and interfaces

### Color Palette
- Primary: Deep blues, purples, and blacks
- Accent: Neon pinks, teals, and oranges
- Metal: Chrome, bronze, and copper tones
- Decay: Rust, grime, and corrosion

## User Interface - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

### HUD Elements - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- Health/Shield indicators - IMPLEMENTED
- Resource inventory - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- Minimap - TO BE IMPLEMENTED
- Active equipment/abilities - TO BE IMPLEMENTED
- Objective markers - TO BE IMPLEMENTED

### Menus - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- Inventory management - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- Crafting interface - IMPLEMENTED
- Character upgrades - TO BE IMPLEMENTED
- Map overview - TO BE IMPLEMENTED
- Settings - TO BE IMPLEMENTED

**IMPLEMENTED**: The health bar is fully implemented as a 3D SceneUI element attached to the player. It displays current health as both a visual bar and text. The crafting interface is fully implemented with support for viewing available recipes, required materials (showing both required and owned quantities), and crafting items. The basic inventory system is implemented in the InventoryManager class which tracks gathered resources, but the visual inventory UI needs further development. Interface elements are defined in the index.html file in the UI assets directory.

## Audio Design

### Sound Categories
- **Ambient**: Background sounds for different environments
- **Interactive**: Feedback for player actions
- **Combat**: Weapon sounds, impacts, enemy alerts
- **UI**: Menu navigation, notifications
- **Music**: Dynamic soundtrack that adapts to gameplay

**IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**: Basic ambient background music is implemented in the main index.ts file. Additional audio categories and dynamic audio features have not yet been implemented.

## Technical Requirements

### HYTOPIA SDK Implementation - IMPLEMENTED
- Entity system for all game objects
- Physics-based interactions
- Multiplayer synchronization
- Procedural generation algorithms

**IMPLEMENTED**: The game is successfully integrated with the HYTOPIA SDK, utilizing its entity system, physics, and world generation capabilities. The player controller extends HYTOPIA's PlayerEntityController to add custom abilities like dash. Resource entities and crafting tables are implemented as custom Entity classes. The SceneUI system is used for health bars and other UI elements. World generation uses the HYTOPIA chunk and block systems. The project structure follows good practices for organization and modularity.
